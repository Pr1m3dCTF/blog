## 1 - Challenge code and Description

```
The final stage of your initialization sequence is mastering cutting-edge technology tools that can be life-changing.
One of these tools is quipqiup, an automated tool for frequency analysis and breaking substitution ciphers.
This is the ultimate challenge, simulating the use of AES encryption to protect a message. Can you break it?
```

**source.py**
```py
from os import urandom
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from secret import MESSAGE

assert all([x.isupper() or x in '{_} ' for x in MESSAGE])


class Cipher:

    def __init__(self):
        self.salt = urandom(15)
        key = urandom(16)
        self.cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)

    def encrypt(self, message):
        return [self.cipher.encrypt(c.encode() + self.salt) for c in message]


def main():
    cipher = Cipher()
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(MESSAGE)
    encrypted = "\n".join([c.hex() for c in encrypted])

    with open("output.txt", 'w+') as f:
        f.write(encrypted)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**output.txt**

## 2 - Solution
+ We know that characters of the encrypted message is Upper letters and `{_} ` which is for teh flag
+ So the message is a text message containing the flag inside it with all upper letter characters.
+ Each character of the message is being encrypted with AES ECB with same key.
+ So each character is mapped to its encrypted version using AES-ECB and we can do statistical analysis.
+ But first we should map these characters to single character random letters except '{_}' we also need space characters to perform statistical analysis
+ How to solve this?

Those AES outputs which has only one occurance are `{}`. so `fbe86a428051747607a35b44b1a3e9e9` is actually `{` and `c53ba24fbbe9e3dbdd6062b3aab7ed1a` is `}`
We can guess `_` is only between `{}` inside flag and not other part of the message so those AES outputs which are between `fbe86a428051747607a35b44b1a3e9e9` and `c53ba24fbbe9e3dbdd6062b3aab7ed1a` is actually `_`
For space the characrter before the flag first character is space and that is `61331054d82aeec9a20416759766d9d5`.

and we should map remaining patterns to a random letter. Here is final script

**solve.py**
```py
import json

datas = open('./crypto_perfect_synchronization/output.txt', 'r').readlines()
raw = open('./crypto_perfect_synchronization/output.txt', 'r').read().strip()
data = []

for d in datas:
    data.append(d.strip())

stats = {}
for d in data:
    if d in stats.keys():
        stats[d] += 1
    else:
        stats[d] = 1

letters = set(data)

chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ '
print(len(chars))

raw = raw.replace('fbe86a428051747607a35b44b1a3e9e9', '{')
raw = raw.replace('a94f49727cf771a85831bd03af1caaf5', '_')
raw = raw.replace('c53ba24fbbe9e3dbdd6062b3aab7ed1a', '}')
raw = raw.replace('61331054d82aeec9a20416759766d9d5', ' ')

index = 0
output = ''
for d in letters:
    if d in['fbe86a428051747607a35b44b1a3e9e9','a94f49727cf771a85831bd03af1caaf5','c53ba24fbbe9e3dbdd6062b3aab7ed1a']:
        continue
    raw = raw.replace(d, chars[index]).strip()
    index += 1

print(raw.replace('\n', ''))
```

result:
```

And here is the flag:
