## Solution

Starting with the challenge when I realized that the challenge is a pdf I searched for `pdf forensics ctf` and came across [this link](https://github.com/xfinest/ctf-Hacker-Resources/blob/master/CTFs_and_WarGames/2014/CSAW-quals/forensics/obscurity/README.md) and so at first try with `Ctrl + A` I found there are some hidden texts inside the circle and so copied and pasted the text and figured the flag out HOWEVER at the time the flag was wrong on the platform and couldn't submit the flag until I saw that there were two solves figured that probably the flag is fixed and it was.
